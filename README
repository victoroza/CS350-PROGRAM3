To make:
make

To run the program you use
./program3 -I <input-file> (which is required)
The optional options are:
-D <Size-Disk> 
-B <Num-Blocks>
<Size-Disk> must be between 16-1024, and Num-Blocks must be a power of 2 and should be <= than half of <Size-Disk>. All flags are optional, all specified flags (except u) require arguments
The usuage string can be shown by running ./program3 -u

The generator program can be run by making and then using:
Usage: ./program3_gen -o <output-file-name> (where to write the commands to)
-O <number-of-operations> (number of reads/writes combined)
-R <which-to-prefer> (R-read, W-write, RAN-random) 
-N <number-of-files> (number of files to use)
-S <file-size> (blocks per file)
